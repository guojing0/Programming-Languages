(* These are basic test cases. Passing these tests does not guarantee that your code will pass the actual homework grader *)
(* To run the test, add a new line to the top of this file: use "homeworkname.sml"; *)
(* All the tests should evaluate to true. For example, the REPL should say: val test1 = true : bool *)
